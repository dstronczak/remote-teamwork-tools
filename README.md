## Retrospectives

#### ðŸ’œ [FunRetro.io](https://funretro.io/) (freemium)

A tool that let's you create boards of various types (Mad - sad - glad / SWOT, etc.) to collaborate in real time. This tool is my personal favourite. It let's you create up to 3 boards for free.


#### [Postfacto](https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto) (free)

Pretty simple and not very flexible retrospective board tool. The thing that's diffrent here is the fact that this is an open source tools which is meant to be self hosted (may be an advantage for some).

#### [Retrium (bu u2i)](https://www.retrium.com/) (free)

Simple, free and very quick to use. This tool was created by a company called U2I. You don't have to host it yourself - you even don't have to create an account. Just take it and use it.

#### [IdeaBoardz](https://ideaboardz.com/) (free)

Another simple and free alternative. Personally I am not a huge fan of it, however I decided to add it here, since it's an another free option.

#### [Linoit](http://linoit.com/) (free)

Basically a real time "corkboard" that let's you add both sticky notes and photos in real time.


#### [Retrium](https://www.retrium.com/) (paid)

Pretty fancy and complicated tool for remote retrospectives. It definitely has a lot of features. The downside: it's not cheap.



#### [Miro](https://miro.com/) (paid)

This "online collaborative whiteboarding platform" is much more than a retro tool. Anyway, fancy retro boards is one of the possible use cases of this it. 

## Planning / estimating

#### ðŸ’œ [PlanITPoker](https://www.planitpoker.com/)  (free)

Nice and simple tool for planning poker sessions. The host needs to create an account, but the rest of participants does not.

#### [ScrumPokerOnline](https://scrumpoker.online/) (free)

Another free tool for planning poker. Here you don't even have to create an account. Enable integrations with github, gitlab and JIRA to load stories / issues. Also, it's an open soruce php app - if you want you can host it yourself.

#### [PlanningPoker](https://www.planningpoker.com/) (paid)

A paid tool for planning poker. Haven't used is myself so I'm not sure if it's worth the money.

## Brainstorming / design

#### [Miro](https://miro.com/) (paid)

Great tool for real time drawing and board creation. Nice to use and has ton of shapes and templates.
