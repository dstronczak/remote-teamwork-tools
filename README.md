## Retrospectives

#### üíú [FunRetro.io](https://funretro.io/) (freemium)

A tool that let's you create boards of various types (Mad - sad - glad / SWOT, etc.) to collaborate in real time. This tool is my personal favourite. It let's you create up to 3 boards for free.


#### [Postfacto](https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto) (free)

Pretty simple and not very flexible retrospective board tool. The thing that's diffrent here is the fact that this is an open source tools which is meant to be self hosted (may be an advantage for some).

#### [Retrium (bu u2i)](https://www.retrium.com/) (free)

Simple, free and very quick to use. This tool was created by a company called U2I. You don't have to host it yourself - you even don't have to create an account. Just take it and use it.

#### [IdeaBoardz](https://ideaboardz.com/) (free)

Another simple and free alternative. Personally I am not a huge fan of it, however I decided to add it here, since it's an another free option.

#### [Linoit](http://linoit.com/) (free)

Basically a real time "corkboard" that let's you add both sticky notes and photos in real time.


#### [Retrium](https://www.retrium.com/) (paid)

Pretty fancy and complicated tool for remote retrospectives. It definitely has a lot of features. The downside: it's not cheap.



#### [Miro](https://miro.com/) (paid)

This "online collaborative whiteboarding platform" is much more than a retro tool. Anyway, fancy retro boards is one of the possible use cases of this it. 

## Planning and estimating

#### üíú [PlanITPoker](https://www.planitpoker.com/)  (free)

Nice and simple tool for planning poker sessions. The host needs to create an account, but the rest of participants does not.

#### [ScrumPokerOnline](https://scrumpoker.online/) (free)

Another free tool for planning poker. Here you don't even have to create an account. Enable integrations with github, gitlab and JIRA to load stories / issues. Also, it's an open soruce php app - if you want you can host it yourself.

#### [PlanningPoker](https://www.planningpoker.com/) (paid)

A paid tool for planning poker. Haven't used is myself so I'm not sure if it's worth the money.

## Brainstorming and design

#### [AWWapp](https://awwapp.com/) (free)

Simlar to Miro - very flexible realtime drawing tool with lots of templates. Unfortnatelly it's not cheap.

## Remote code sharing and pair programming

### Offline code / workspace sharing

### Editor / IDE sharing

#### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (free)

Visual Studio Code is a great text editor many people use daily as their main IDE. It's also a great tool for remote pair programming, there are three plugins that can make VSCode the only tool you need to code together remotely. These are:

[LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) - main plugin you will need, it enables to work together remotely using the same editor workspace, with live file editing, etc.

[LiveAudio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-audio) - enables you to add an audio call to your remote collaboration session, without a need to use an extra app for that.

[LiveChat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karigari.chat) - enables you to add text messaging between remote collaboration session participantas, instead of using external comminicator.

#### Alternative editors for live collaboration

Remote pair programming is available in Cloud9, allowing developers to share their preview, the running application, and even their entire program development, and program with their collaborators in real time.
