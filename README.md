## Retrospectives

#### üíú [FunRetro.io](https://funretro.io/) (freemium)

A tool that let's you create boards of various types (Mad - sad - glad / SWOT, etc.) to collaborate in real time. This tool is my personal favourite. It let's you create up to 3 boards for free.


#### [Postfacto](https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto) (free)

Pretty simple and not very flexible retrospective board tool. The thing that's diffrent here is the fact that this is an open source tools which is meant to be self hosted (may be an advantage for some).

#### [Retrium (bu u2i)](https://www.retrium.com/) (free)

Simple, free and very quick to use. This tool was created by a company called U2I. You don't have to host it yourself - you even don't have to create an account. Just take it and use it.

#### [IdeaBoardz](https://ideaboardz.com/) (free)

Another simple and free alternative. Personally I am not a huge fan of it, however I decided to add it here, since it's an another free option.

#### [Linoit](http://linoit.com/) (free)

Basically a real time "corkboard" that let's you add both sticky notes and photos in real time.


#### [Retrium](https://www.retrium.com/) (paid)

Pretty fancy and complicated tool for remote retrospectives. It definitely has a lot of features. The downside: it's not cheap.



#### [Miro](https://miro.com/) (paid)

This "online collaborative whiteboarding platform" is much more than a retro tool. Anyway, fancy retro boards is one of the possible use cases of this it. 

## Planning and estimating

#### üíú [PlanITPoker](https://www.planitpoker.com/)  (free)

Nice and simple tool for planning poker sessions. The host needs to create an account, but the rest of participants does not.

#### [ScrumPokerOnline](https://scrumpoker.online/) (free)

Another free tool for planning poker. Here you don't even have to create an account. Enable integrations with github, gitlab and JIRA to load stories / issues. Also, it's an open soruce php app - if you want you can host it yourself.

#### [PlanningPoker](https://www.planningpoker.com/) (paid)

A paid tool for planning poker. Haven't used is myself so I'm not sure if it's worth the money.

## Brainstorming and design

#### [Miro](https://miro.com/) (paid)

Great tool for real time drawing and board creation. Nice to use and has ton of shapes and templates.

## Remote Pair programming

### Editor / IDE sharing

#### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) (free)

Visual Studio Code is a great text editor many people use daily as their main IDE. It's also a great tool for remote pair programming, there are three plugins that can make VSCode the only tool you need to code together remotely. These are:

[LiveShare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) - main plugin you will need, it enables to work together remotely using the same editor workspace, with live file editing, etc.

[LiveAudio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-audio) - enables you to add an audio call to your remote collaboration session, without a need to use an extra app for that.

[LiveChat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karigari.chat) - enables you to add text messaging between remote collaboration session participantas, instead of using external comminicator.

#### Alternative editors for live collaboration

[Atom](https://atom.io/) with [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) (free) - If you prefer Atom more than VSCode, there is a beta version of Atom plugin called Teletype. 

[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) (free) - a modern, open source code editor founded by Adobe that offers collaborative features. You simply need to open your project folder, press the sync icon on the right toolbar, and enter the same room ID.

[Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) (paid) - a cloud IDE from Amazon.  Remote pair programming is available in Cloud9, allowing developers to share their preview, the running application, and even their entire program development, and program with their collaborators in real time. Collaborators will be able to see each other‚Äôs cursors as they type, run the app, share the Terminal(s), and talk in a group chat.

### Screen sharing + remote control
